# remove-fb-friends
mass remove facebook friend

From webbrowser

1) Go to https://m.facebook.com/friends/center/friends
2) Open console and paste jquery-min code https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js
3) Copy paste and execute the remove.js code

You can set the delay for each remove in setInterval(greet, 200)
By default it is set to 200ms, but we advise not to set it lower because otherwise facebook may identify you and block your ability to remove any friends at all.
