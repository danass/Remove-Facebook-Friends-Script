# remove-fb-friends
This code help you to mass remove all your friends from facebook automatically.

From your web browser you will need the console to execute the following code.

1) Go to https://m.facebook.com/friends/center/friends
2) Open console and paste jquery-min code https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js
3) Copy paste and execute the remove.js code

You can set the delay for each remove in setInterval(greet, 200)
By default it is set to 200ms, but we advise not to set it lower because otherwise facebook may identify you and block your ability to remove any friends at all.
